### Hi there 👋
# ¡Hello, i am Angel Uriel Campos Avila! 👋

## About me

I'm a passionate backend developer with skills in various programming languages, including Typescript, JavaScript, Java, Go, Scala, Python, and R. Additionally, I have experience in frontend development using React, Next.js, React Native, and Flutter, showcasing my versatility on both ends of the spectrum.

## Tecnologías

- Backend: Typescript, JavaScript, Java, Go, Scala, Python, R
- Frontend: React, Next.js, React Native, Flutter

## Featured Projects

1. **Odemaster** - I developed this application using Flutter, which has the unique capability to measure acoustic pollution in the user's environment. In addition to accurate measurements, the app generates detailed statistics on noise levels and harnesses the power of geocomputation to create statistical maps that provide a comprehensive and visually impactful view of acoustic pollution in a specific area. This tool not only provides valuable information about sound quality but also contributes to awareness and understanding of noise patterns in the environment.

## Future goals

I'm excited to learn Rust and explore new opportunities to enhance my skills as a developer.

## Fun Facts

My favorite animal is the dove 🕊️. And, between us, I once, as an intern, accidentally deleted the dev database 😅.
